# seniorProject2020
Final project for my capstone course at Farmingdale State College.
---
**High Concept:**
The project concept was a "Handy Man Finder"; essentially a webhub for users to search and schedule home development and repair services in order to start a contract job. 
This was done with local businesses in mind but is mainly just a proof of concept, and was mainly done as a way to get into web development. 

**Tech Used:**
The backend was done with just node.js and mySQL while the frontend was EJS templating(+ vanilla HTML + CSS) with the node-express framework for the routes. 
I had this project live on Google Cloud for a bit but took it down a month after my final presentation was done. Hosting it on google was actually a lot harder than I expected, as most aspects of the project had to be refactored. Even after that, many different google services had to used at once, which was a bit annoying to figure out.

As my first project where I picked up node for the first time, I think I did pretty well. While there was only about 60-75% of the total user stories complete it was a very rewarding learning experience and is what lead me to pursue full-stack development further.
